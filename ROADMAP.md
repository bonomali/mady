* Bug: update details when key changes (if possible)

* Cut release
* Add Google Translate (triggers for all new keys and languages, sent to users asynchronously)
* Show error when user specifies a language that doesn't exist
* Use Giu's DataTable
- Improve creation subscriptions, so that they no longer require full data downloads
* Fix Jest running: it never stops when testing locally (it does in Travis)
* Bump to React 16 (check correct scrollbar width upon first re-render at the client side)
* Bump other deps

Someday: *Nothing identified right now!*
